Final fantasy 3 grind bot! Grind... hogie... I'm running out of bot names and
don't want to expend too much mental energy coming up with a wittyish name for
one of my simpler bots.

Usage
-----

* Install autoit
* Get characters to a safeish area (taking minimum damage)
* Right click on view and run the version corresponding to your machine (x64 on 64 bit windows)
* Profit

Note: Does not detect current HP or anything, so get nice items and such before
(using perhaps a quick memory hack?).
Note2: Yes your characters can die easily and lose the game. Don't run all 
night, just an hour at a time or so (unless you use accompanied memory hack).

Memory Hack
-----------

I've included a basic table of cheat engine-generated memory addresses of some
popular things. Install cheat engine and double click the file to run. slot1-4
represents the character's hp in different slots. It can always be activated
(frozen) except when fighting the darkness the first time. Maxing at 9999
always works. Another is money, aka gil. 99999 is max as well, andcan always be
activated.
