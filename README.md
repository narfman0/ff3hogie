Final fantasy 3 grind bot! Grind... hogie... I'm running out of bot names and
don't want to expend too much mental energy coming up with a wittyish name for
one of my simpler bots.

Usage
-----

* Install autoit
* Get characters to a safeish area (taking minimum damage)
* Right click on view and run the version corresponding to your machine (x64 on 64 bit windows)
* Profit

Note: Does not detect current HP or anything, so get nice items and such before (using perhaps
a quick memory hack?).
Note2: Yes your characters can die easily and lose the game. Don't run all night, just an hour
at a time or so.
